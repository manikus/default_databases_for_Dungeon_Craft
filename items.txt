// Item database file
//	The line above **must** be the first line of the items file!!!
//	
//	Total validation is performed when reading this data. Nothing you do can cause the program to crash.  It may spit error messages and quit for lack of something decent to do but it will not crash or do unexpected things. It shouldn't anyway. If it does, please let us know.
//	
//	The first item has the name "template" and will be ignored.  You can use it as a 'template'.  Copy it to the bottom of the file and edit the copy to add your item to the database.
//	
//	Each line is of the form    name = value (value may be omitted)
//	eg:		Special Ability = 
//	This line will be interpreted as setting 'Special Ability' to the empty string.  This is commonly the default so in many cases it is the same as omitting the line entirely.
//	
//	White space is a bit important.  Because names and values can contain blanks.  So the rule is....leading and trailing whitespace are ignored.  So, for example:
//		attack bonus         =     3         <cr>
//		attack bonus=3<cr>
//	are equivalent.  But
//		attack    bonus = 3
//		attack bonus = 3
//	are different.
//	
//	Lines starting with two slashes are comment lines.  Like this one.
//	
//	Attribute names are case-insensitive.  
//		Name = Wimpy Axe
//		namE = Wimpy Axe
//		NAME = Wimpy Axe
//	are equivalent.
//	Text values retain their case.  Values with enumerated possibilities are case-insensitive.  Example  baseclass = PaLaDiN     + FiGhTeR+ThIeF
//	
//	File names can use the UNIX syntax with slashes because the backslash is used to escape special characters and it gets ugly to put double backslashes everywhere.  If you like to use backslashes you may. We will accept either.  Even mixed in a single filename.
//	Example:    C:/UAF\\src\\guild of ravens/release1/beta\\art/barkeep.bmp
//	
//	Item definitions are delimited by \(BEGIN) ........ \(END) which must start in column 1.  This ain't free format. You get what you pay for.  
//	
//	 ************ Now for the interesting part  ***********
//	
//	Each item is defined by the following fields:
//	
//	Name (text, required - item record ignored if missing or blank).
//	
//	Each item mut have a unique name.  You may add a qualifier to a name (separated with a vertical bar) to make it unique.  For example:
//		Axe
//		Axe|Sharp
//		Axe|Dull
//	The qualifier is only used when editing a design.  The qualifier is discarded when the binary files for the design are created.  But the unique name is necessary during the design stage to allow unambiguous references to the items.  During gameplay they are identified by a binary integer 'key' so there is no confusion between the three Axes even though they all print as 'Axe'.
