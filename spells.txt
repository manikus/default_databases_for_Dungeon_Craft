// Spell database file
// The line above **must** be the first line of the spells file!!!
//
//	Total validation is performed when reading this data. Nothing you do can cause the program to crash.  It may spit error messages and quit for lack of something decent to do but it will not crash or do unexpected things. It shouldn't anyway. If it does, please let us know.
//
//	The first item has the name "template" and will be ignored.  You can use it as a 'template'.  Copy it to the bottom of the file and edit the copy to add your item to the database.
//
//	Each line is of the form    name = value (value may be omitted)
//	eg:   
//		Special Ability = 
//	This line will be interpreted as setting 'Special Ability' to the empty string.  This is commonly the default so in many cases it is the same as omitting the line entirely.
//
//	White space is a bit important.  Because names and values can contain blanks.  So the rule is....leading and trailing whitespace are ignored.  So, for example:
//		attack bonus         =     3         <cr>
//		attack bonus=3<cr>
//	are equivalent.  But
//		attack    bonus = 3
//		attack bonus = 3
//	are different.
//
//	Lines starting with two slashes are comment lines.  Like this one.
//
//	Attribute names are case-insensitive.  
//		Name = Wimpy Axe
//		namE = Wimpy Axe
//		NAME = Wimpy Axe
//	are equivalent.
//	Text values retain their case.  Values with enumerated possibilities are case-insensitive.  Example  cLaSs = PaLaDiN     + FiGhTeR+ThIeF
//
//	File names can use the UNIX syntax with slashes because the backslash is used to escape special characters and it gets ugly to put double backslashes everywhere.  If you like to use backslashes you may. We will accept either.  Even mixed in a single filename.
//	Example:    C:/UAF\\src\\guild of ravens/release1/beta\\art/barkeep.bmp
//
//	Item definitions are delimited by \(BEGIN) ........ \(END) which must start in column 1.  This ain't free format. You get what you pay for.  
//
//  ************ Now for the interesting part  ***********
//
//	Each spell is defined by the following fields:
//
// Name (text, required)
//	Each spell must have a uniue name.  You may add a 
//	qualifier to a name (separated with a vertical bar) 
//	to make it unique.  For example:
//		Dimwittify
//		Dimwittify|sorta
//		Dimwittify|really
//
//	The qualifier is only used when editing a design.  The 
//	qualifier is discarded when the binary files for the 
//	design are created. But the unique name is necessary 
//	during the design stage to allow unambiguous references 
//	to the spells.  During gameplay they are identified 
//	by a binary integer 'key' so there is no confusion 
//	between the three Dimwittifies even though they are 
//	all printed as 'Dimwittify'.
//	default - all blanks (which makes the entire spell a comment)

// Spell Effect
// Specify which character attributes are modified by this spell. To modify multiple

//  
// Format:
// Attribute,Change Amount(diceplus format),Change Units, Targeting, Cumulative
//
//    Attribute = attribute keyword affected, such as $CHAR_THACO
//    Change Amount = how much to change attribute value, such as 1d4 + level + 2
//           This is a signed number. To decrease the current value, use a
//           negative Change Amount.
//    Change Units = 'delta', 'percent', or 'absolute'.
//           Delta value is added to current value
//           Percent changes current value by given percentage
//           Absolute changes current value to given value
//    Targeting = 'target','targeter','alltargettypes'
//           target = affects spell target
//           targeter = affects whomever targets the spell target (combat only)
//           alltargettypes = all of the above
//    Cumulative = 'yes' or 'no', will this attribute change have affect if
//                 same attribute already modified from same or different spell?
// Examples:
//  spell effect 1 = $CHAR_AC, 1d4+2, delta, target, yes
//  spell effect 2 = $CHAR_THACO, 1d6, percent, alltargettypes, no
//
//  Activate Script
//
//  Modify Script
//	This script is only called if there is a Spell Effect script and will match up
//	with a specific one, i.e. Modify Script 1 goes with Spell Effect 1, etc.
//	Modify Script acts directly on the third argument of Spell Effect, which is the
//	amount or kind. The modifier can be any appropriate GPDL function or script.
// Example:
//	spell effect 1 = $CHAR_HITPOINTS,-level,delta,target,yes
//	modify script 1 = $RETURN -# ($GET_CHAR_Lvl($IndexOf($AttackerContext()),"ranger") -# 8);
