// Class database file
// The above line **Must** be the first line in the classes database. "// Class database file"
//
//	Each class is defined by the following fields:
//	
// name = (text)
//	Names should not conflict with any of the names in the baseclass database,
//	items database, spells database, races database, or abilities database,
//	all baseclasses start with a lower case letter and classes with an upper case letter.
//	eg:		name = Gray Elf
//
// HitDiceBonus (baseclass name, ability name, bonus1 - bonus25) 
//	If a baseclass receives a Hit Point bonus for an ability, it is noted with this keyword
//	If the class has more than one baseclass, each may have it's own
//	bonus listed and that bonus will apply as levels are gained
//	with that particular baseclass
//	eg:		HitDiceBonus = fighter,Constitution,0,0,-2,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,6,6,7,7
//
// HitDiceBaseclass (*Average*/*Maximum*)
//	HitDiceBaseclass may have a value of *Average* or *Maximum* and
//	applies when more than one baseclass is part of a class. *Average* means
//	that the average of all hit dice is taken, *Maximum* means the max number
//	for that level is given.
//	Default: *Average*
//	eg:		HitDiceBaseclass = *Average*
//
// StrengthBonusDice (nDm)
//	If the class allows a bonus for Strength of 18, it is determined here in the
//	format of nDm, where n is the number of dice and m is the number of sides.
//	default:	blank
//	eg:		StrengthBonusDice = 1D100
//
// Starting Equipment (item name)
//	If the class starts with any items they are listed with this keyword.
//  Multiple items require multiple instances of the keyword
//	eg:		Starting Equipment = Awl Pike
//
// baseclass (baseclass name)
//	This is the baseclass that the class is based upon. There
//	ust have at least one per class and there may be up to three.
//	eg:		baseclass = fighter
//
// Special Ability (special ability name)
//	Each Special Ability corresponds to the Special Ability
//	database and list the name and parameter.
//	One Special Ability per instance of the keyword, which
//	may be listed multiple times.
//	eg:		Special Ability = class_NoSpells,fighter
